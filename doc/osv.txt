|one-small-step-for-vimkind| (osv) is an adapter for Lua running inside Neovim. 
It will allow you to:

  * Debug Lua scripts
  * Debug a running component inside Neovim (like a plug-in)
  * Debug Neovim internal Lua scripts

In order to use |one-small-step-for-vimkind|, you will need a DAP client.
You can choose between two alternatives which are:

  nvim-dap: https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap
  vimspector: https://github.com/puremourning/vimspector

|one-small-step-for-vimkind| was mainly developed with nvim-dap which
is the one recommanded.

                                  Type |gO| to the table of contents.

Please refer |dap-adapter| and |dap-configuration| to know about about
nvim-dap configurations.

The following configuration will allow you to attach a nvim-dap
client to |osv|.

  local dap = require"dap"
  dap.configurations.lua = { 
    { 
      type = 'nlua', 
      request = 'attach',
      name = "Attach to running Neovim instance",
      host = function()
        local value = vim.fn.input('Host [127.0.0.1]: ')
        if value ~= "" then
          return value
        end
        return '127.0.0.1'
      end,
      port = function()
        local val = tonumber(vim.fn.input('Port: '))
        assert(val, "Please provide a port number")
        return val
      end,
    }
  }

  dap.adapters.nlua = function(callback, config)
    callback({ type = 'server', host = config.host, port = config.port })
  end
<

You might prefer to have a constant port number so that you don't have to
enter it everytime. |osv.launch| can be 
launched on a specific port if you pass it the port number as an argument.

Quickstart~

The following steps will guide you through the process to start
a debugging session using nvim-dap.

Let's say you have a lua script `myscript.lua` in your home directory.
It has the following content: >

  print("start")
  for i=1,10 do
    print(i)
  end
  print("end")
<
1. Open a Neovim instance (instance A)
2. Launch the DAP server with (A) >
 :lua require"osv".launch()
< Note: Write down the port number
3. Open another Neovim instance (instance B)
4. Open `myscript.lua` (B)
5. Place a breakpoint on line 2 using (B) >
  :lua require"dap".toggle_breakpoint()
<6. Connect the DAP client using (B) >
  :lua require"dap".continue()
< Note: host - Press return, leave default
       port - Enter the port you wrote down
7. Run `myscript.lua` in the other instance (A) >
  :luafile myscript.lua
<8. The breakpoint should hit and freeze the instance (B)

Todo

=========================================================================
Launch server                                               *osv-server*

To start a debugging session, you will first need to launch the server. 

launch({opts})                                           *osv.launch()*

This command will launch the DAP server awaiting any connections. On
execution, a prompt message will display the port it's running on.

    Parameters:~
        {opts} Optional parameters.
               • `host`: defaults to "127.0.0.1"
               • `port`: Specify a port number or if nil, lets the server
               choose an available port.
               • `log`: boolean to enable logging

    Return:~
        An server info object which contains 
          {host = {host}, port = {port}} 
        or nil on failure

The |osv.launch()| function will actually not 
run the server in the running process but spawn a child process. 
This ensures that DAP requests are still processed even in a 
frozen state.

run_this({opts})                                        *osv.run_this()*

    Parameters:~
        {opts} Optional parameters.
               • `log`: boolean to enable logging

This command will automatically start the DAP server and connect
nvim-dap to it. You still need to set the `dap.adapters.nlua` as 
explained in the configuration section.

stop()                                                     *osv.stop()*

This command will stop the running dap server. Following the DAP
standard, an "exited" event + an "terminated" will be sent to the client
so that it knows the server has exited.

=========================================================================
osv logging                                                 *osv-logging*

Logging can be enabled by passing the corresponding parameter in
|osv.launch|. The log will be written in:
>
  echo stdpath('data') . '/osv.log'
<

osv plugins debugging                             *osv-plugins-debugging

Note: These explanations only are valid if you're using packer.nvim for
other plugin managers such as vim-plug you don't need to take special
precautions to debug plugins

As an example, let's say you're developing a plugin which is located
in a directory on your system. You would install it using:
>
  use '...path to your plugin.../my-plugin.nvim'
<
After installing `my-plugin.nvim` using packer.nvim, a symlink will be created
inside the `nvim-data`  which points to your local plugin directory.

The symlink is located in `nvim-data/pack/packer/start/my-plugin.nvim`.  See
`:echo stdpath('data')` to check where your `nvim-data` directory is located.

When your plugin is executed from within nvim, it won't call the files
located inside your local directory but go through the symlink.

This means that breakpoints should also be set in the files which are
located inside the symlink so that executed files and the files which
contain breakpoints match and stop on trigger.

In consequence, reopen the files through the symlink and place the breakpoints
there to properly trigger them.

=========================================================================
osv repl                                                      *osv-repl*

The REPL supports evaluation of expression. It will prepend a "return "
statement which will return the value of the expression to the debugger.
This means expressions such as assignments will not be valid syntax.
